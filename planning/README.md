# Planning

<!-- outline your project's big idea so everyone agrees:

  - What question(s) are you investigating?
  - To whom will you be communicating the results?
  - What action(s) can you ask them to take?

  it's expected that your goals will shift as the project progresses
  you should change your plans as you learn more about the domain and your audience

-->
