# Repository Setup

- [ ] The repository has a helpful name
- [ ] The repository has a helpful description
- [ ] There are some relevant tags to make the repo searchable
- [ ] Require a code review for PRs to `main`/`master`
      \([owanateamachree](https://owanateamachree.medium.com/how-to-protect-the-master-branch-on-github-ab85e9b6b03),
      [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/approving-a-pull-request-with-required-reviews)\)
  - You will need to type `main` or `master` into the _Branch name pattern_
    input box \(depending on which on what your repo's default branch is
    named\)
  - Select _Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed_
- [ ] Created a milestone for each project phase:
  - **Planning**
  - **Data & Domain**
  - **Analysis & Results**
  - **Audience & Communication**
  - **Retrospective**
- [ ] Create a project board with these columns, you can put the `help wanted` label on an issue in any of these columns:
  - **TODO**: planned tasks that no one is working on
  - **DOING**: tasks someone is actively working on
  - **READY FOR REVIEW**: tasks that someone has finished, but have not been reviewed
  - **NEEDS REVISION**: reviewed tasks that are not ready to merge (move these back to _DOING_ when you are working on them again)
  - **DONE**: tasks that have been merged
- [ ] Turn on discussions (if your team wants to use them)
